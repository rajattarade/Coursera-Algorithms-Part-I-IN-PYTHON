# Coursera-Algorithms-Part-I-IN-PYTHON
I'm writing the snippets of code I learn in Coursera 'Algorithms, Part I' in Python language using Google Colab... It's just a practice for myself as I'm trying to improve my Python Skills and Algorithms (and also I don't like or know Java)

I'll keep updating the Notebook as I go furture into the course.

Implemented so far

Week 1
    Quick Find
    Quick Union 
    
Week 2
