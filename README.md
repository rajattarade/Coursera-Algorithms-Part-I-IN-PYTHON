# Coursera-Algorithms-Part-I-IN-PYTHON
I'm writing the snippets of code I learn in Coursera 'Algorithms, Part I' in Python language using Google Colab... It's just a practice for myself as I'm trying to improve my Python Skills and Algorithms (and also I don't like or know Java)

I'll keep updating the Notebook as I go furture into the course.

<h2>Implemented so far...</h2>

<h3>Week 1</h3>
    <p> Quick Find </p>
    Quick Union 
    
<h3>Week 2</h3>
    <p> Stack using LinkedList </p>

p.s. I'll not be publishing any Assignments as it is against Coursera Honor Code
